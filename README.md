# MobProgNativeProject-ChefSwipe
Assignment for Mobile Programming with Native Technologies

This project covers kotlin fundamentals, encompassing the use of Firebase, with aspects Java, xml etc.

The idea behind the project is a recipe app, which makes use of Firebase authentication for user login, alongside Firestore to retrieve recipe data.
This app is built similarly to apps like "Tinder"; in this case, if the user likes the idea recipe, they may "swipe right" to view the full recipe.
They may also "swipe left" to skip the recipe and move onto the next!

The application implements firebase to authenticate users in the registration and login pages, and once the user has been authenticated they are automatically logged in on app startup.

The navigation bar can be used to switch between the pages; allowing the user to view recipe cards, edit profile settings like email or password, or logout of the app.

I used firestore to host all of the recipes, from their name to the link to their instructions. Screenshots of this can be found [here](https://imgur.com/a/ZkfleGu)
